Our consultants spend a lot of their time looking for vulnerabilities in commercial software, open source software, hardware and firmware. We provide this service free of charge to the companies involved, and assist them with fixing the vulnerabilities found if they so require. 
All vulnerability disclosures are handled in a responsible way in above and beyond industry standards, giving ample time to the companies involved to fix these flaws.

In addition, our consultants regularly participate in world renowned hacking competitions such as [Pwn2Own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwn2Own), where they have uncovered dozens of vulnerabilities, won hundreds of thousands of dollars in prizes and outclassed teams from multinational corporations competing in the same events.

Since the founding of Agile Information Security, our consultants have made public over 200 vulnerabilities in well known and widely used software such as:

* Several enterprise and consumer network devices from Cisco, Netgear, Dlink, Asus and others
* Various SCADA / Industrial Control Software products
* Cisco Enterprise Management software

* HPE / Micro Focus Enterprise Management software
