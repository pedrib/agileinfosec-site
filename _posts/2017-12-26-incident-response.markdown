title: Incident Response & Network Monitoring
---

Even the best security systems fail, and sometimes all that is needed is a careless employee or developer that allows a hacker inside your network. Incidents occur, and when they do, the best is to deal with them as quickly as possible.

### Incident Response
If you are the victim of a hacking attack or security breach, we can assist you with:

- Securing the network and kick out the attackers.
- Determining the cause of the breach.
- Establishing what information was stolen or deleted, and what damage was done by the attackers.
- Monitor the network to ensure the attackers do not come back.
- Ensuring that similar breaches do not happen again.


### Network Monitoring
We can also help you develop your Network Monitoring capabilities.

Our consultants have plenty of experience assist small and large organisations with creating, developing and improving their [Security Information and Event Management][siem] systems. Our objective is to provide you with knowledge, tools and training in order to be able to increase staff competence and expertise in order to monitor your own networks and respond to security events.

Our unique application and infrastructure security knowledge can quickly identify gaps in your logging capabilities, monitoring systems and data flow tracking, and provide you with cost effective solutions to fill those gaps.
