title: Secure Architecture & Threat Modelling
---
Most companies perform penetration tests, code reviews and similar risk management exercises on their products. 

However, this is a case of "closing the stable door after the horse has bolted". In reality, proper security engineering starts at the design phase of any product. 
Designing your product with security in mind is 1000 times less costly than doing it after releasing it. 

At Agile Information Security, we have ample experience helping clients develop secure software. We help you analyse the data flows, components, authentication, authorization, data storage, encryption and other key parts of the product to ensure they are secure from the start, saving you millions of dollars in future problems.

Having said that, if your product is already in production and needs an update to it's architecture, or if you would like to perform a Threat Modelling exercise in order to uncover possible vulnerabilities and risks, we are here to assist you.

We recommend these services to any company that is developing products for commercial, government, law enforcement or military use.
